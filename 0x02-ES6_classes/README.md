## Introduction

ES6 classes are a new way to define and create objects in JavaScript. They provide a cleaner syntax and a more intuitive way to work with object-oriented programming concepts.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to ES6 classes, covering various topics such as class syntax, constructors, instance methods, static methods, inheritance, getters and setters, private fields, and modules.

## Class Syntax

ES6 classes are defined using the `class` keyword. They can have properties and methods, just like traditional constructor functions.
