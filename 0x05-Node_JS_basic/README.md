## Introduction

In this course, we will learn the basics of Node.js and how to build server-side applications using JavaScript. We will cover topics such as modules, file system operations, HTTP server, Express.js framework, and testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with Node.js, you need to install it on your machine. Visit the official Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set up Node.js.

## Modules

Node.js uses a module system to organize and reuse code. In this section, we will learn how to create and use modules in Node.js.

## File System

Node.js provides a built-in module called `fs` that allows you to work with the file system. We will explore various file system operations such as reading and writing files, creating directories, and more.

## HTTP

Node.js has a built-in module called `http` that allows you to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests. We will learn how to create a simple HTTP server and handle different types of requests.

## Express.js

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive way to build web applications and APIs. We will learn how to set up an Express.js application, define routes, handle requests, and more.

## Testing

Testing is an essential part of software development. In this section, we will learn how to write unit tests for our Node.js applications using the `jest` testing framework.

## Conclusion

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of Node.js and be able to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Let's get started!
